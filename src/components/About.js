      <p>Hello, my name is Steve Neiman. I am a student at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, where I am passionate about learning and mastering various technologies in the field of web 
development. With a focus on full-stack development, I am gaining expertise in a wide range of tools and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, GraphQL, 
and MongoDB with Mongoose. I enjoy the process of transforming design concepts into fully functional and visually appealing websites. Throughout my journey at the bootcamp, 
I have developed a strong foundation in database management, utilizing SQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I have been exploring the power of GraphQL,
 which allows for flexible and optimized data querying. With the use of MongoDB and Mongoose, I am adept at building robust and scalable back-end systems. Continuous learning 
 is at the core of my approach, as I strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices. Please take a moment to explore my portfolio and feel free to reach 
 out if you would like to connect and collaborate on exciting web development projects!</p>
